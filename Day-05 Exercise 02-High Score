#1. inputs are been taken and been stored in list
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores \n").split()
#2. for loop is applied and number of items are stored in variable 
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
#3. variables are initiated and for loop are applied to optain sum of heights and number of student
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  highest_score > score
  highest_score = score
#4. result is been printed with using round function
print(f"The highest score is : {highest_score}")

#5. High Score without using max function.

#6. See the example at:
