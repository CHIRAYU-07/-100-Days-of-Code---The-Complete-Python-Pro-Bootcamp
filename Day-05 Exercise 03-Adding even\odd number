#1. variables are initiated
total_e,total_o = 0,0
#2. for loop are applied to optain sum of even and odd number
for even_num in range(0,101,2):
  #print(even_num)
  total_e += even_num
print(total_e)

#                     OR

#3. for loop are applied to optain sum of even and odd number 
for odd_num in range(0, 101):
  if odd_num % 2 != 0:
     #print(odd_num)
     total_o += odd_num
print(total_o)
