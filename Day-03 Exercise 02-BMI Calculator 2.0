#1. Inputs are taken of height in meters and weight in kilogram
height = (input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = (input("enter your weight in kg: "))
#2. Converted to floating datatype
h = float(height)
w = float(weight)
#3. Actual formula is applied to get bmi of a person
bmi =round( w / (h**2))
#4. Print the bmi in floating datatype
print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}")
#5. basic if/else,nested if/else and if/elif/else are executed.
if bmi < 18.5 :
  print("You are underweight,Eat healthy nutrient-rich food,Do effective workouts as well ")
elif bmi < 25 :
  print("You have normal weight but keep Eating healthy food and keep doing workouts")
elif bmi < 30 :
  print("You are slightly overweight,Eat some healthy food,Do effective workouts")
elif bmi < 35 :
  print("You are obese,Eat some healthy food,Do more workouts")
elif bmi > 35 :
  print("You are clinically obese,Eat only healthy food,Do more workouts")
else : print("Under 18.5 they are underweight, \n Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight, \nOver 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight, \n Over 30 but below 35 they are obese, \n Above 35 they are clinically obese.")
